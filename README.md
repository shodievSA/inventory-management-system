- <b>Console-based inventory management system in C++ (for Windows users only). The program generates .xlsx file in the project's source directory to enable users to visually monitor their inventory.</b>

- <b>Requirements:</b>
  - libxl library (https://www.libxl.com/download.html).

- You can learn how to set up this library at https://www.libxl.com/vscpp.html.
- By default, the "IMS.vcxproj" file specifies the location of include_cpp and lib64 folders at "C:\libxl-4.3.0.14\include_cpp" and "C:\libxl-4.3.0.14\lib64" respectively. You can either replicate this configuration or change it in the project's properties.
